about-author: Welcome! This website is designed to share all the things that make me smile, including running many miles. I am a fourth year undergraduate pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of California, Davis. When I need a break from using my left brain, I enjoy writing, practicing my French, and training for my second marathon.
